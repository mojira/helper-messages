        You have selected the version "1.6.93 (legacy)" as affected version for your report. Nowadays most users are using the new native launcher.
        If the launcher you are using has a big green "PLAY" button for starting the game, then you are using the new launcher. To find out the version you are using, please click on "Settings" in the lower left corner, then open the "About" tab. Right below "Launcher" it shows the version of the launcher.
        Please update the affected versions of your report by removing "1.6.93 (legacy)" and choosing the correct version.

        In case you are actually using the legacy launcher, consider switching to the new native launcher. It can be downloaded [here|https://www.minecraft.net/download/alternative].

        You reported a parity issue. We are only tracking parity issues that meet the following criteria on this bug tracker:
        * The feature affected by the parity issue is present in both Bedrock Edition and Java Edition in the latest release or development version
        * The feature behaves differently in one edition than in the other
        * The parity issue was introduced in Buzzy Bees (Bedrock Edition 1.14 / Java Edition 1.15) or later and was not present before
        
        Any parity issue that does not meet these criteria are not tracked on the bug tracker and should instead be reported on the [Feedback website|https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/topics/360001191251-Parity].

        Thank you for taking the time to report a bug. Unfortunately we are only able to accept bug reports in English since it is the common language used on this tracker.

        You are welcome to create a new ticket about your issue in English. You can use an online translator, if it helps.
        However, please [*+search+*|https://bugs.mojang.com/issues/] before writing a new bug report, as it's very likely that someone else already reported your issue before.
        If you find an existing ticket about your issue, you can add a vote and any new information to it instead of reporting it yourself.
