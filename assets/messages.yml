        * On Windows you can use the Export world feature.
        * On Android or iOS you need to use a file explorer to navigate to _Device storage > games > com.mojang > minecraftWorlds_
        * On Xbox or Switch the only way is to upload it to a Realm, and then download the world on Windows 10 or Android/iOS. _(Please do not purchase a Realms subscription just to provide a world to us - but if you have a Realm already this may be a viable option if you wish to do so.)_
        * On PlayStation you can follow these steps to copy a world save:
        ## Make sure your BLANK USB stick has been formatted to FAT32
        ## On your PlayStation, go to Settings > Application Saved Data Management > Saved Data in System Storage > Copy to USB Storage Device > Select Minecraft > Select Saved World to copy > Copy
        ## This should then copy the world save to the USB, which you can share to a file sharing site such as OneDrive, and then share the link.

        Crashes such as these are logged automatically by the game or server and investigated further by the development team internally, so they are not generally kept on the bug tracker.

        If you can provide a list of steps that someone else can follow to consistently reproduce a crash then feel free to create a new report.

        You reported a parity issue. We are only tracking parity issues that meet the following criteria on this bug tracker:

        * The parity issue was introduced in Buzzy Bees (Bedrock Edition 1.14 / Java Edition 1.15) or later and was not present before

        Any parity issue that does not meet these criteria will not be tracked on the bug tracker and should instead be reported on the [Minecraft Feedback Discord server|https://aka.ms/MinecraftFeedbackDiscord].

        Issues such as these are often due to a temporary service outage, and are handled by the team outside the bug tracker.

        Watch [Mojang Status|https://twitter.com/MojangStatus] for official announcements, or [Downdetector|https://downdetector.com/status/minecraft] for community reported outages.

        If there is no general outage, please first try to verify that the problem is not with your local connection or network settings. Afterwards contact *%help_discord%* for assistance and refer to this ticket by providing a link.
        You might also try to deactivate any VPN in use, and check your firewall settings. If your device supports mobile data, try switching to wifi. If possible, try using a different wifi network.
