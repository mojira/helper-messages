        However, we recommend making use of the [*+search feature+*|https://bugs.mojang.com/issues/] before writing a new bug report, as it's very likely that someone else already reported your issue before.
        If you find an existing ticket about your issue, you can add a vote and any new information to it instead of reporting it yourself.

        Please note that this bug tracker is not for support. If you have a payment issue or an issue with your account, please contact *[Customer Support|https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/requests/new]*.
