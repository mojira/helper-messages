# Mojira Helper Message Application

This VueJS application is developed by Mojang's Mojira Team, the bug tracker helpers and moderators. "Mojira Helper Message Application" aggregates & serves copy + paste messages for use in comments on the bug tracker.

## How to use the tool

We use GitHub pages to dynamically deploy the web app after something was changed in the repository. You can get to the live version of this repository [here](https://mojira.github.io/helper-messages).
