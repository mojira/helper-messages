# Mojira Helper Message Application

This web application is developed by Mojang's Mojira Team, the bug tracker helpers and moderators. "Mojira Helper Message Application" aggregates & serves copy + paste messages for use in comments on the bug tracker.

⚠ Please note that the helper messages may only be used on the bug tracker by helpers, moderators or Mojang staff. Do not use them yourself if you do not belong to one of these groups as it may confuse users regarding your role.

## How to use the tool

We use GitHub pages to dynamically deploy the web app after something was changed in the repository. You can get to the live version of this repository [here](https://mojira.github.io/helper-messages).

## Contribute

Issues and pull requests are always very much appreciated. Please make sure to give reason for changing helper messages in `messages.yml` in your PR. If you are a Mojira helper / moderator and have access to this repository, you don't have to create a PR, but you can. 

Changes in the `master` branch will be auto deployed to GitHub pages; there's no need to manually update.
